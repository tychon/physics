## fmt

* plotting convenience function with DIN A4 size

* helper function for plotting fit result?

## fit

* use scipy.optimize.least_squares instead of minimize with bounds?

* extra file.py for test functions

* support passing a function for the Jacobian
* support passing a tolerance for termination

## doc

* write TeX document with mathematical explanations for alorithms
   (Hessian, Jacobian, chi2, chi2red, BFGS, LM, ...)
